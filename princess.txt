Once upon a time, there was a brillant princess. She was a young and successful
researcher in artificial intelligence.

One night, she goes to the grand Kingdom University Bal. There, she encounters 
a beautiful, radiant girl. They immediatly lock gazes and fall in love with each
other.

But when midnight strikes, the mysterious girl suddenly runs! The princess pulls
out her phone and try to take a picture of her, but in the rush, she could only
get her shoe.  That is probably not legal with respect to privacy, so please
don't do that, but it is okay in this Kingdom.

The princess languishes. But she remembers a paper that she recently reviewed,
DeepShoe, which uses deep learning to reconstruct the github handle of a person
from a simple picture of a shoe! How fortunate!

Even more fortunate, the paper comes with code, a rarity. She downloads the
repository. The tool requires Python, which she already has. Excited, she starts
the script. But there's an problem. After reading the README, it turns out the script needs
Python2, while she has Python3. She fears not, because the two can be installed
on the same system. Using her system package manager, she installs python2, and tries again.

The python bindings to opencv, an image processing library, are now missing.
Using the python package manager pip, she installs it, and tries again. But it
still fails, with the strangest error. After a lengthy investigation, she finds
out the python bindings depends on a system installation of opencv 1.14, while
she has 2.0 installed.

To hell the other packages that depends on opencv! For love, she uninstalls the system
package and tries to install the right version. She moves heaven and
earth to find a solution. She tries to use her system package manager. She tries
to install it from a script. She tries to build it from the repository. Without success.

This is a sad story, but it is not an unchangeable fate.
